# PURESET

> A personal, project and organizational task manager

Pureset is built upon the idea that no matter what kind of task management you use, each task is
essentially the same thing; simply a unit of work - be that a project, a bug or a ToDo.

A ticket is a bug, a bug is a task, a task is a ToDo...

So if the above is true, and everything in Pureset is a task, then we can begin to create
experiences for any type of task.


## Issue Contexts

Every issue is based upon the context they were created within. For example, if an issue is created
while looking at a project, then that issue will be automatically associated with that project, and
will have a context of "project".

The following contexts exist:

 - User
 - Organization
 - Project
